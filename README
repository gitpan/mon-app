INTRODUCTION
------------

"mon" is a tool for monitoring the availability of services. Services
may be network-related, environmental conditions, or nearly anything
that can be tested with software.  It is extremely useful for system
administrators, but not limited to use by them. It was designed to be a
general-purpose problem alerting system, separating the tasks of testing
services for availability and sending alerts when things fail. To achieve
this, "mon" is implemented as a scheduler which runs the programs which
do the testing, and triggering alert programs when these scripts detect
failure.  None of the actual service testing or reporting is actually
handled by "mon". These functions are handled by auxillary programs.

This model was chosen because it is very extensible, and does not require
changing the code of the scheduler to add new tests or alert types. For
example, an alphanumeric paging alert can be added simply by writing a
new alert script, and referencing the alert script in the configuration
file. Monitoring the temperature in a room can be done by adding a script
that gathers data from a thermistor via a serial port.  Often these
monitoring scripts can just be wrappers for pre-existing software, such
as "ping" or "ftp".

The "mon" scheduler also can serve network clients, allowing manipulation
of run-time parameters, disabling and enabling of alerts and tests,
listing failure and alert history, and reporting of current states of
all monitors.

There are several clients which come with the distribution, found in
cgi-bin/ and clients/ :

    -moncmd, which is a command-line client. moncmd supports the full
     functionality of the client/server interface.

    -monshow, a dual command-line and CGI interface report generator
     for showing the operational status of the services monitored by
     the server.  It displays nicely-formatted columnar output of the
     current operational status, groups, and the failure log.

    -skymon, which is a SkyTel 2-Way paging interface, allowing
     you to query the server's state and to manipulate it in the same
     manner as moncmd, right from your pager. Access is controlled via
     a simple password and an access control file.

    -mon.cgi, which is an interactive web interface, allowing
     you to not only view status information, but to change parameters
     in the server while it is running.
