muxpect is not yet complete. It is a work-in-progress.

The purpose is to have a monitor which can multiplex TCP connections on
the same port to multiple destinations and do chat-style interaction on
them all in parallel. Given this functionality, many of the TCP-based
monitors in mon.d can be replaced by this code, making things much
more efficient.
