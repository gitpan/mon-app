This is a "moncmd" interface to a SkyTel 2-way pager. It utilizes
procmail filters and password authentication to do its trick.
I would not call this a "secure" authentication mechanism, but in
Marcus Ranum-speak it is "really nice". Use at your own risk.

It would be even more "really nice" if this did SecureID or S/Key.

Also keep in mind that all queries and all results pass through the
Great Wide Internet to get back to your pager.


INSTALLATION

1.

Do this from the /usr/doc/mon/examples directory:

mkdir ~/.skytel
chmod 0700 ~/.skytel
cp skymon.allow ~/.skytel/allow


2.

Create an encrypted password using the following Perl snippet,
substituting "password" with the password that you want, and "salt" with
a *2-letter* salt.

perl -e 'print crypt("password", "salt"), "\n"' > ~/.skytel/password
chmod 0600 password


3.

Add the contents of the "skymon.procmail" file to your .procmailrc.


OPERATION

Commands are sent via email with the following format:

/password:command

Commands are the following, and can only be used if they exist in the
"allow" file:


eh			enable host
es			enable service
ew			enable watch

dh host reason		disable host
ds watch service reason	disable service
dw watch reason		disable watch

lf			list failures
ld			list disabled


The idea behind the brevity is that it's a pain to compose messages
on that silly little keypad.
