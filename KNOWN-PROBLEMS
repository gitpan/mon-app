KNOWN PROBLEMS in 0.99.2
--------------------------

clients/skymon has not yet been updated to work with the new Mon::Client
API.

monerrfile is not documented in mon.8

the 'all' directive for auth.cf is not specifically enumerated in
mon.8

monerrfile doesn't work unless the server is in daemon mode, which
should be made clearer.

monerrfile is buffered, which is a PITA if you're trying to debug
something and there's a 5 minute lag between the time stderr/out is
written and the time you see it in your file, depending on how long it
takes the buffer to fill. I experiemented a little with select() and $|
to try and get this unbuffered, but wasn't able to make it work.
